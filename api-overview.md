# {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} API overview
{: #api-overview}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST APIs, and the corresponding SDKs, to develop applications that interact with the service. There are two versions of the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} API, each supporting a different set of functions: v1 and v2. The API you should use depends on the type of methods your application requires:

- **Runtime methods**: Methods that enable a client application to interact with (but not modify) an existing assistant or skill. You can use these methods to develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.

  The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} v2 API provides access to methods you can use to interact with an assistant at run time (such as `/message`). This is the preferred API to use for developing new client applications. For details about the v2 API, see the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} [v2 API Reference](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/assistant/assistant-data-v2){: external}.

  The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} v1 API includes a `/message` method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill, bypassing the assistant. The v1 runtime API is supported primarily for backward compatibility purposes. If you use the v1 `/message` method, your app cannot take advantage of the orchestration and state-management capabilities of an assistant. For more information, see [Using the v1 runtime API](/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-api-client#api-client-v1-api).

- **Authoring methods**: Methods that enable an application to create or modify dialog skills, as an alternative to building a skill graphically using the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool. An authoring application uses various methods to create and modify skills, intents, entities, dialog nodes, and other artifacts that make up a dialog skill.

  To build an authoring application, use the v1 API. For more information, see the [v1 API Reference](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/assistant/assistant-data){: external}.

  **Note:** The v1 authoring methods interact with workspaces rather than skills. A workspace is a container for the dialog and training data (such as intents and entities) within a dialog skill. For most purposes, when using the API you can think of workspaces and dialog skills as interchangeable; for example, if you create a new workspace using the API, it will appear as a new dialog skill in the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool.

For a list of the available API methods, see [API methods summary](/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-api-methods).
